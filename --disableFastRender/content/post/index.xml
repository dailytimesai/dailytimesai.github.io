      <description>What is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight, plain-text formatting language used for creating styled text through simple, readable syntax. Developed by John Gruber in 2004, its goal is to allow writers to format documents without complex code, making it easy to read and edit. The beauty of Markdown lies in its simplicity, allowing creators to add headings, lists, images, links, and more by typing a few symbols around their text.</description>

      <description>Headings To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (h3), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header). Heading level 1 Heading level 2 Heading level 3 Heading level 4 Heading level 5 Heading level 6 Paragraphs To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.</description>

      <description>Who am I ?! This is the most asked question in my life. Yet no clear answer has yet been found.&#xA;As a child, the answer to this question was simple. Say my name to the question of who. Aha ..! Simple and beautiful. In that answer, parents and siblings in adolescence. I thought to myself that the answer was too clear.&#xA;When I started asking myself this question at a young age when I was beginning to recognize many things, I began to feel that the answer was becoming less clear.</description>
